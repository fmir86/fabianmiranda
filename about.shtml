					<div id="profileTextWrap">
						<p>As a "natural born" motion designer and a well trained programmer I love to combine both disciplines to create stunning web experiences that exceeds the norm.</p>
						<p>I am a veteran of a thousand battles in Flash Professional which definitely is my biggest area of expertise. From small banners to huge applications. Whatever the challenge is, it doesn't matter since I have probably been there. This phase of my career gave me the chance to “think outside of the box” when it comes to design and develop web content and interactive media. Now I continue applying this approach, but taking advantage of emerging technologies like html5, which allow us as developers to reach bigger audiences, especially that fast-growing community of mobile users.</p>
						<p>As a self-taught person I am constantly learning, always trying to be one step forward to the client´s needs. Specialized in front-end technologies and object oriented languages I really enjoy to create content in platforms such as html5 and Flash.</p>

							<h4>Lead Front End Engineer</h4>
							<p>“(...) Who would ever figure that we pretty much became dependant on his mad skills and relentless dedication? Seriously this guy is just too much.

						<h2>STUDIES &amp;<br/>CERTIFICATIONS</h2>
					
						<p><img id="diploma" src="images/diplomaCert.svg" width="130" height="98" alt="diplima"/>First I achieved a technical degree in Advertising&nbsp;Design. Focused on the traditional way to make print advertisement and related. It was in 2003. After that, I was more interested on how internet was revolutionizing the way to communicate ideas, and learning about websites creation was my next goal.</p>
						<p>I was studying completely by my own until 2006, and after little more than a year I completed a Professional Web Designer studies program in a Adobe Certified learning center.</p>
						<p><img id="adobeCert" src="images/adobeCert.png" alt="Adobe Expert"/>In 2010 I earned the Adobe Certified Associate (ACA) level in Flash Professional CS4 via Certiport, and six months later I achieved the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) in a Pearson Vue certification center. A year later, in 2011 I was able to earn the ACE in Flash Professional CS5. Now I am looking forward to take the ACE recertification exam in Flash Professional CS6.</p>
						<p><img id="mediamindCert" src="images/mediamindCert.png" width="276" height="108" alt="<Mediamind"/>In 2012, I achieved the MediaMind Certification for producing rich media ads through their platform. I also have received recently an online trainings with MediaMind trainers about their HTML5 specifications.</p>
						<p>During 2013 and 2014 I have become into a fully certified DoubleClick Developer. This includes the core certification, as much as the html5 and Flash specializations. Also I recently earned the Quality Assurance badge, and other badges that certified me as a trusted producer of Rich Media formats like Youtube mastheads, dynamic ads and engagement ads.</p>
						<img id="dcbadges" src="images/dcbadges.png" alt="DoubleClick Badges"/>
						<p>Nowadays, I am focused in increasing my skills and expertise in standard front-end technologies, learning advanced Javascript programming, interested in frameworks such as Angular, CSS preprocesors, and all these new tools that are gaining a lot of attention these days.</p>
