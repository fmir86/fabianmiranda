						<p>Now and more than ever, email marketing is considered as one important cornerstone of every well planned web-marketing campaign. But its proper execution is vital, and the several browsers and email clients out there makes this process very complex, since of course you want your email announcement  showing nice and clean across every email client and platform.</p>
						<p>An strict quality assurance strategy  is needed since the very beginning of the production phase and a rock-solid methodology of development must be followed.</p>
						<p>As team lead I have been the chance to learn from the best ones in this field, and teach to other teammates and set standards and best practices. Also I am currently researching about the new wave of email development, the “responsive” emails which modifies its layout according to the screen size of the user´s device.</p>
