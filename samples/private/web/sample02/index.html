        <p>Offer valid for new clients who do not have a Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.

Net deposits will be calculated daily, and the trades will be credited to your account within one week of confirmation of your qualifying net deposit. The trades will be applied only to the enrolled account and apply only to base equity, exchange-traded fund (ETF), and options commissions. Options per-contract, foreign transaction, exchange, and regulatory fees still apply. Only trades placed through Schwab.com, Schwab trading platforms, and Schwab Wireless are eligible. Trades will expire 180 days after being credited to your account and will not be applied to previously executed trades. No credit will be given for unexecuted trades.</p>
